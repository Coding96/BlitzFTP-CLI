# BlitzFTP-CLI
first attempt at a full mesh network ftp file sharing program another version will be made later to handle a gui

#
# Anybody is welcome to work on this 
# The idea is a distrubted system for 
# File sharing based on the combination of two existing ideas
# 1) A full mesh Network such as I2P
# 2) IRC's CTCP protocol 
#
# Hopefully this will allow a file sharing
# Network that does not require a server
# after initial seeding :)
